In this Project, I deployed the Super Mario game on AWS EKS cluster.

**STEPS**
1. Launch an EC2 instance
2.  Setup Docker, Terraform, AWSCLI, Kubectl on EC2 with the help of their documentation
3.  Create IAM role and attach it with EC2 instance
4.  Build Infrastructure using terraform
5.  Create deployment and service for EKS
6.  Destroy all Infrastructure otherwise it'll cost huge :)
